- **Multilingual Support**: Available in English and German with language-specific analysis
- **Community Feedback**: User voting system to improve AI accuracy over time
- **Real-time Results**: Instant analysis with confidence ratings and detailed explanations
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Privacy Focused**: No data collection, analysis happens in real-time

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Lucide React** for icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

**OR**

- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

### Local Development (Node.js)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd bullshit-detector
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Docker Deployment

#### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd bullshit-detector
```

2. Make the startup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x docker-start.sh
```

3. Start the application:

**For Development:**
```bash
./docker-start.sh dev
```
Application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

**For Production:**
```bash
./docker-start.sh prod
```
Application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
./docker-start.sh dev

# Start production environment
./docker-start.sh prod

# Stop all containers
./docker-start.sh stop

# View logs
./docker-start.sh logs

# Clean up Docker resources
./docker-start.sh clean
```

#### Manual Docker Commands

**Development:**
```bash
docker-compose --profile dev up --build
```

**Production:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d bullshit-detector
```

**Stop containers:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks

## How It Works

1. **URL Input**: Users paste a news article URL
2. **Content Fetching**: The system attempts to fetch and parse the webpage content
3. **AI Analysis**: Multiple analysis layers examine:
   - Content structure and quality
   - Source credibility indicators
   - Language patterns and bias detection
   - Publisher reputation
4. **Results Display**: Users receive a bullshit rating (1-5) with detailed explanations
5. **Community Feedback**: Users can vote on accuracy to improve the system
